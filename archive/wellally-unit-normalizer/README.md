[![中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-中文-red)](README.zh.md)

L2 utility for normalizing medical measurement units (e.g., mg/dL ↔ mmol/L) to keep data consistent.

## Capabilities
- Unit detection and parsing.
- Bi-directional conversions with traceability.
- Batch conversion for pipelines.
- Validation to ensure safe conversions.

## Examples
- Glucose: mg/dL ↔ mmol/L
- Cholesterol: mg/dL ↔ mmol/L
- Triglycerides: mg/dL ↔ mmol/L
- Additional lab metrics as needed.

## Use Cases
- Standardizing mixed-unit lab feeds before aggregation and analytics.
- Harmonizing device readings with clinical lab standards.
- Preprocessing step for ML pipelines to ensure unit consistency.

## Status
Planned.
